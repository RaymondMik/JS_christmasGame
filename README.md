# JS_christmas_game

A simple Christmas game I made with just vanilla JavaScript and CSS. On the left side of the screen there is one dog more then on the right side. Click/tap on the extra dog on the left side and you will get 100 points. Points and levels assigned to the player are changing as the game progresses. Can you score more than 2000 points in 60 seconds?<br>
I developed this little game for my 9 year old cousin, using pictures of her puppy dog. You can <a href="http://labs.ramonmiklus.com/jsgame/" target="blank">try it here</a>
