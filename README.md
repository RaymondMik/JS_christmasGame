# JS_christmas_game

A simple Christmas game built with vanilla JavaScript. On the left side of the screen there is one dog more then the right side. Can you score more than 2000 points in 60 seconds?
I developed this simple game for my 9 year old cousin, using pictures of her puppy dog. You can <a href="http://labs.ramonmiklus.com/jsgame/" target="blank">try it here</a>
